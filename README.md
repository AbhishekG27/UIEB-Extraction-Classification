## üåä Overview

The UIEB (Underwater Image Enhancement Benchmark) dataset is a specialized collection designed to address challenges in underwater imaging, including color distortion, low contrast, and blurring caused by light scattering and absorption in water environments.

This project implements and compares multiple feature extraction techniques combined with various machine learning classifiers to automatically identify different types of underwater image degradations.

## üìä Dataset

The UIEB dataset contains underwater images with various degradation types that commonly occur in underwater photography and imaging systems.

## üéØ Applications

- **Marine Research**: Enhanced visual data analysis for marine biology studies
- **Underwater Exploration**: Archaeological documentation and artifact analysis
- **Photography & Videography**: Aesthetic quality improvement for underwater media
- **Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs)**: Enhanced performance in mapping, inspection, and surveillance

## üîç Degradation Types

The analysis covers eight main types of underwater image degradations:

- **Low Illumination**: Images with overall low brightness
- **High Contrast**: Images with extreme light-dark differences
- **Hazy**: Images with reduced clarity due to haze
- **Blurry**: Out-of-focus images
- **Noisy**: Images with significant visual noise
- **Red Tint**: Images dominated by red color cast
- **Blue Tint**: Images dominated by blue color cast
- **Green Tint**: Images dominated by green color cast

## üõ† Feature Extraction Methods

### Structural Features
- **Sparse PCA**: Identifies important color features contributing to overall color variation
- **HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients)**: Captures structural and texture features
- **Sparse + HOG**: Combined sparse coding with HOG features for enhanced discriminative power
- **HOG + PCA**: Comprehensive feature set combining texture and color information

### Color-Based Features
- **Dominant Color Descriptor**: Captures prominent colors using k-means clustering
- **Color Coherence Vector**: Measures spatial coherence of colors
- **HSV Histogram**: Color distribution in HSV color space
- **Color Layout Descriptor**: Spatial color representation using grid averaging
- **Color Name Descriptor**: Maps colors to predefined color names
- **Opponency Color Features**: Captures color channel differences (red-green, yellow-blue)

## üìà Classification Results

### Best Performing Combinations

| Method | Best Classifier | Accuracy |
|--------|----------------|----------|
| Color Coherence Vector | Gradient Boosting | 97.25% |
| HSV Histogram | Logistic Regression | 95.00% |
| SVM + Colour Histogram | SVM | 93.11% |
| Dominant Color | Gradient Boosting | 92.50% |

### Overall Method Comparison

| Classifier | Sparse PCA | HOG+PCA | HOG+Colour | Colour Histogram |
|------------|------------|---------|------------|------------------|
| Random Forest | 78.51% | 37% | 97% | 97.40% |
| Gradient Boost | 76.12% | 67% | 99% | 96.83% |
| KNN | 75.91% | 13% | 73% | 90.24% |
| Decision Tree | 74.15% | 56% | 89% | 92.69% |

### Color Method Classification Results
When using adaptive feature extraction based on degradation type:
- **Random Forest Classifier**: 100% accuracy
- **Gradient Boosting Classifier**: 100% accuracy
- **Gaussian Naive Bayes**: 97.92% accuracy
- **Logistic Regression**: 97.92% accuracy
- **MLP Classifier**: 97.92% accuracy

## üîë Key Findings

1. **Ensemble methods** (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) consistently outperform individual classifiers
2. **Color-based features** generally provide better discrimination than structural features alone
3. **HOG + Colour Histogram** combination achieves exceptional results (99% with Gradient Boosting)
4. **Adaptive feature selection** based on degradation type can achieve perfect classification
5. **Color Coherence Vector** with Gradient Boosting shows the highest single-method performance (97.25%)

## üöÄ Usage

```python
# Example usage structure
# 1. Load and preprocess UIEB dataset
# 2. Extract features using chosen method
# 3. Train classifier
# 4. Evaluate performance

# Feature extraction example
